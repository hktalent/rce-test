        <title> Installation</title>
        <para os="windows">On Windows, a single zip file is provided to set up client and server
            installations. You only need to extract the zip file to a location on your file
            system.</para>
        <para os="windows">IMPORTANT: Please note that due to restrictions of the standard Windows
            file system (NTFS), you should choose a destination path that is as short as possible.
            Long paths are known to cause problems, as some RCE files may not be properly extracted
            from the zip file.</para>
        <para os="linux">Starting with RCE 6.0.0, there are two installation options on Linux:
            installing RCE from .deb/.rpm packages, or extracting it from a zip file (which was
            traditionally used by RCE 5.x and before). Whenever possible, using the packages is
            recommended, as RCE is properly installed into the proper system locations, and can be
            cleanly managed using your distribution's package manager. If you are on a Debian-based
            distribution, a package repository is provided as well, which makes it even easier to
            install and upgrade RCE. These options are described below. (TODO 6.0.0 add comparison
            matrix of Linux installation options)</para>
        <sect3 os="linux">
            <title>Debian/Ubuntu/Mint - Installing from the Package Repository (recommended)</title>
            <para>To register the RCE .deb package repository in your system, you have to add the
                repository location, and add the RCE signing key. Then, you can install RCE like any
                other software package. These steps can either be done with a graphical tool, or
                from the command line; both have the same effect.</para>
            <para>Before you start, you need to create a text file with the signing key as described
                in the "Digital Signatures ..." section below. This is used to automatically verify
                all RCE packages before the package manager installs them.</para>

                        see an entry "RCE 6.x Automatic Signing Key" in the list of known keys.
                        Close this dialog, and refresh the list of packages. After this, you should
                        find an entry "rce" in this list (for example, using the "quick search"
                        box), which you can install like any other software.</para>

                made to work, it creates unnecessary complications regarding installation paths and
                file permissions. As registering a daemon requires root privileges anyway, there
                should be no reason to use the .zip file anyway; if you have a compelling use case
                for this, please contact the RCE team.</para>
            <para os="linux">Once RCE is properly installed, registering it as a daemon is very
                simple. A command named <code>rce-daemon</code> is provided to control the whole
                daemon life cycle. The only manual step you need to perform before is creating a
                user account that the daemon will run under. For now, this account has to be named
                    <code>rce-daemon</code>; use you distribution's console commands or GUI tools to
                add it. (Please note that this account needs to have a home directory to hold the
                daemon's profile directory.) Future RCE versions will make this account name
                customizable.</para>
            <para os="linux">Once this user account is created, you can use the following commands
                to manage the daemon installation:<itemizedlist>
