 * Internal callback interface for the communication bundle and transport implementations. It is

 * low-level connection breakdowns. These are handled internally by the communication layer, and are
 * not meant to propagate to the original request senders.
 * 
 * For these senders, connection breakdowns are converted into {@link NetworkResponse}s and returned
 * via the {@link NetworkResponseHandler#onResponseAvailable(NetworkResponse)} callback. If the
 * breakdown occurred on an outgoing connection, this will usually be followed by a
 * {@link MessageChannelLifecycleListener#onOutgoingChannelTerminated(MessageChannel)} callback.
