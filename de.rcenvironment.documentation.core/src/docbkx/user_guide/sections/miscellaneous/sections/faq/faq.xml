		<title>How can I update RCE to the latest version?</title>
		<para>To update RCE to the latest version, select <emphasis role="italic">Help->Check for
				Updates</emphasis> from the main menu. If a new version is available you will be
			guided through an update wizard. Otherwise, a dialog will inform you that your current
			version is up to date.</para>
		<para>Alternatively, you can download a full RCE release at any time again. In most cases, this is
			less convenient than using the update option mentioned above, because you will lose all
			settings (window positions etc.) you made in the old RCE instance. However, your
			projects and the workflow files inside of them are stored in the workspace folder
			(located in {rce installation dir}/workspace by default). To transfer them to the new
			installation, either move this folder to the default location of the new installation
			(as above, this is {rce installation dir}/workspace), or choose the old workspace folder
			location when starting the new instance.<note>
				<para>If you choose the second way (full reinstallation), make sure that you do not
					accidentally delete the workspace folder along with the old installation.</para>

		<title>Why doesn't RCE start up? </title>
		<para>Known issues are:</para>

				<para>You may not have Java 7 installed. You can check this by executing the
					following line in a command/terminal window (command prompt etc.): <code>java
						-version</code>. If you get a message telling you that Java 7 is
					installed, everything is fine. Otherwise, please install a Java Runtime
					Environment (JRE) of version 7 first.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>There may not be enough available RAM on the target system. In the {rce installation
					dir}/rce.ini file, two parameters control how much memory RCE tries to allocate.
					The <code>-Xms</code> option specifies the minimum amout (which is used right
					after startup), and the <code>-Xmx</code> option specifies the maximum amount of
					RAM to use. For example, <code>-Xms256m -Xmx512m</code> defines that the
					instance starts with 256 Mb, and may use at most 512 Mb. <note>
						<para>For technical reasons, the exact RAM usage will be slightly higher, as
							these numbers only control a certain type of memory the application
							uses.</para>
					</note></para>
				<para>Decrease the default parameters and try to start RCE again. Adjust until you
					find the highest amount that you can allocate on the target system.<note>
						<para>Memory-intensive operations may fail when running RCE with a reduced
							maximum memory pool (the <code>-Xmx</code> option).</para>

		<title>How to suppress the splash screen in headless (non-GUI) mode? </title>
		<para>Start RCE with the command line parameter <code>-noSplash</code>.</para>
		<para>If you don't like to suppress the splash screen via a command line parameter on every RCE
			start, you can suppress the splash screen permanently by adding the
			appropriate command line parameter to the rce.ini: Open the {rce installation
			dir}/rce.ini file in a text editor and add somewhere above <code>-vmargs</code> the line <code>-noSplash</code>.</para>
